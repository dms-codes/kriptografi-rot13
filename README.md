# Simple Caesar Cipher Encryption

This Python script performs a simple Caesar cipher encryption and decryption on a given plaintext message. It shifts each letter in the alphabet by 13 positions to the right for encryption (Caesar cipher with a shift of 13), and reverses the process for decryption.

## Features

- Encrypts plaintext messages using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 13.
- Decrypts ciphertext messages by reversing the Caesar cipher process.
- Preserves spaces in the input message.
- Supports uppercase letters.

## Usage

1. Modify the `plaintext` variable with the message you want to encrypt.

2. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

3. The script will perform the encryption and print both the ciphertext and the decrypted message.

## Example

Suppose you have the following line of code in your script:

```python
plaintext = 'SELAMAT DATANG DI KELAS KRIPTOGRAFI'
```

After running the script, you will see the following output:

```
FRYNZN GNFGNA QV XRYNF XEVFCBENSV
SELAMAT DATANG DI KELAS KRIPTOGRAFI
```
